

This is the README File for installing new languages (if youre language does not exists) or installing the EN File for your Server.

1. HOW TO INSTALL EN
	Go to the folder 'EN' located in the locales folder of this resource, copy these two files,
	then go back to the kick_restart folder, and simply paste the files there, WITHOUT the EN Folder.
	Your System will ask you if you want to replace the files in this folder, simply click on yes, or replace button!
	Now it should be translated. If there are some problems, please reply on the original Topic!
	
2. HOW TO INSTALL A NEW LANGUAGE
	1. Make a folder in locales and call it like you want. For example use EN (English) if you want this language. <-- that's only my Idea on it.
	2. copy from another folder the files (example: folder; EN) and paste it in your new folder.
	3. now go into server.lua and tranlate everything in these characters: "text" BUT! Do not translate "chatMessage" this is very IMPORTANT!
	4. ENJOY! :)	
PERMISSION

If you want to share your translation of this resource, you can go ahead. But please make sure to call the resource "kick_restart:language" or something in that way,
that way the users of fivem know what this post is about and they wont go mad in your Release because less description or anything.
Everything else of PERMISSIONS is located in kick_restart/PERMISSIONS
