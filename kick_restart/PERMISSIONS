RE-RELEASING

	If you want to RE-RELEASE this Resource you have to ask in the Original Topic for it, or PM me.
	If you ask for it I will write you back and ask for a download link. 
	Why?
	I do this to check if there are changes which are acceptable to upload again. I will not accept things like only change the description
	or simply delete some files. If you want to RE-RELEASE something, then there has to be a new function, that makes it acceptable.

UPLOAD LANGUAGES

	You can Upload your languages in the Original Topic or make a new Release Topic. Please Read for that the README.md located in locales.
